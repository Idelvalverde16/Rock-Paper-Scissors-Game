# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Reviewing DOM manipulation by building a rock, paper, scissors game.

In the previous projects I learned how to work with basic DOM manipulation. It was time to review what I have learned by building a Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

In this mini project, I reviewed conditionals, functions, getElementById, and more. This project gave me an opportunity to solve small problems and get a better understanding of the basics.
